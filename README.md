🔗 Live Demonstration of my Portfolio: https://j-abid.github.io/Public-Portfolio/

Public-Portfolio is a sophisticated, single-file web architecture that pushes the boundaries of client-side rendering. By integrating React, Three.js, and a custom WebGL Fluid Simulation engine directly into the browser via Babel Standalone, this project delivers an immersive, zero-dependency portfolio solution that requires no build steps or backend servers.
Designed for high-impact visual storytelling, it features a proprietary Content Management System (CMS) built entirely in JavaScript. This system allows the site owner to securely modify content, visual themes, and layout structures in real-time through a private, password-protected interface.

✨ Key Features & Capabilities

🌌 Immersive Visual Core

WebGL Fluid Dynamics: Features a custom Navier-Stokes fluid solver running on WebGL2, creating a high-performance, interactive background that reacts to cursor velocity and pressure.
Procedural 3D Environment: A fully interactive 3D scene rendered via Three.js, featuring a customizable planetary system, rotating rings, particle fields, and dynamic lighting.
Glassmorphism UI: A modern, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS, utilizing frosted glass effects to blend UI elements seamlessly with the dynamic background.

🔐 Private Owner-Controlled CMS

Secure Dashboard: A password-protected admin interface allows only the site owner to manage the portfolio directly from the front end. Visitors see a read-only version.
Inline Content Editing: Transform static text into editable fields instantly. Click to update bio details, experience timelines, or project descriptions without touching code.
State Persistence: Utilizing LocalStorage API, all changes are saved instantly within the browser environment, with options to export/import state as JSON for backup.

🌐 Enterprise Social Media Grid

A highly advanced, interactive system for managing digital presence:
Drag-and-Drop Architecture: Visually reorder social icons via a tactile drag-and-drop interface within the admin panel.
Cursor-Based Scalar Resizing: A unique "Edit Mode" allows the owner to click and drag icons horizontally to scale them in real-time.
Live Customization: Full control over icon colors, tooltips, and destination URLs, with updates syncing instantly across all site sections.

📁 Dynamic Project Management

Media Handling: Upload images and videos directly into the application state via Base64 encoding.
Case Study Builder: Add, edit, or remove detailed project cards, including technical stacks, descriptions, and gallery layouts.

🛠️ Technical Stack

⚛️ React 18: Leveraged via CDN for component-based architecture.

📦 Three.js: Powering the 3D planetary and cosmic scenes.

💧 WebGL: Custom shaders for the fluid simulation layer.

🎨 Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling for rapid UI development.

⚡ Babel Standalone: In-browser JSX compilation for a serverless experience.

🎭 AOS: Animate On Scroll library for smooth transition effects.

🚀 Deployment & Usage
This project utilizes a Serverless / Build-less Architecture.
To deploy or run locally, simply open the portfolio-max.html file in any modern web browser. No npm install, webpack, or build processes are required.
Designed and engineered for performance, aesthetics, and ease of management.
